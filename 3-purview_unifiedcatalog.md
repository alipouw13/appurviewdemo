## Core Concepts
Below are core Purview Unified Catalog concepts.

| Concept                        | Definition | Purpose | Elements | Permissions |
|-----------------------------|------------|---------|----------|----------|
| [Unified Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/unified-catalog)     | Centralized repository to browse, store, and manage metadata about data assets. | Provide a single source of truth for data assets. | Discovery (Data products, Data assets, Enterprise glossary), Catalog management (Governance domains, Data products, Requests, Classic types), Health management (Controls, Data quality, Actions, Reports) | See below for a full list. As a start - Read: Data catalog reader <br> Read and edit roles: Governance Domain Admin |
| [Governance Domains](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-governance-domain)    | Provide context to data assets based on governance requirements and business context, making it easier to scale governance practices, manage security, compliance and metadata consistency. | A boundary that enables the common governance, ownership, and discovery of data products and business concepts. | Name, description, [type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-governance-domain#types-of-governance-domains), parent (optional), Data products, OKRs, Glossary terms, Critical data elements (CDEs), policies, Health actions, Data quality score | Read: Data catalog reader <br> Read and edit: Governance domain creator (create domains), Governance domain owner (curate metadata) |
| [Data Products](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-data-products)    | Curated sets of data assets that are given context to be packaged and made available for consumption, made to enable scalability and discoverability. | Enable scalability and discoverability of data. | Name, description, owners, list of associated data assets, [type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-create-manage-data-products#data-product-types) | Read: Data catalog reader <br> Read and edit: Data product owner |
| [Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-okr) | Framework for setting and tracking business objestives and measurable outcomes attached to governance domains and data products. | Link data products directly to real business objectives to cross the gap between the business and the data estate | Objective definition, owners, target date, key results (definition, current progress status, current progress value, goal and max progress target), linked data products | Read: Data catalog reader <br> Read and edit: Data steward |
| [Glossary Terms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concept-glossary-terms)              | Standardized definitions of business terms used across the organization. | Aim to provide context and apply policies that determine how your data should be managed, governed, and made discoverable for use. Policies within these terms allow data stewards to scale governance across your entire data estate. Terms applied to data products trickle down to the data assets and automatically secure those resources with their attached policies. | Name, Description, Governance domain, Owner, Custom attributes, Related (Terms, Data products, CDEs), Policies | Read: Data catalog reader <br> Read and edit: Data steward
| [Critical Data Elements (CDEs)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-create-manage-critical-data) | A logical grouping of important data elements that are essential for business operations and decision-making. | CDE groupings make data easier to understand and to promote standardization. Data quality rules and access policies can be attached to these elements to further secure sensitive information across your data estate. | Governance domain, Name, Description, Owner, Expected data type (Number, text, date/time, boolean),  Columns, Policies, Glossary terms | Read: Data catalog reader <br> Read and edit: Data steward |
| [Data Quality](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/data-quality-overview)                | Measures and processes to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of data. Provide the ability to assess and oversee the quality of the data ecosystem, facilitating targeted actions for improvement and ensure reliability of data to improve AI-driven insights and recommendations. |  Poor data quality or incompatible data structures blocks business processes and decision-making capabilities. Data Quality in Purview offers the ability to evaluate data quality using no-code/low-code rules, including out-of-the-box (OOB) rules and AI-generated rules. | Scanned data source, [Data Source connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-create-connection-to-datasources-for-data-quality-scan#setup-data-source-connection), [Data profiling run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/how-to-configure-and-run-data-profiling)  | Read: Data quality reader, Data quality metadata reader <br> Read and edit: Data quality steward |
| [Health Actions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/data-estate-health-actions), Create and run a new or suggested rule or run an[available rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/concepts-data-quality-rules#available-data-quality-rules) - input criteria will change depending on the rule   | Provide concrete steps to take to maintain or improve the quality and governance of data assets. | Provide actions to raises your health score and promote an overall more useable and discoverable  Catalog | See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/data-estate-health-actions#available-actions) for available actions | Read: Data quality reader, Data quality metadata reader <br> Read and edit: Data quality steward |
| [Live View](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/live-view)                   | Provides automatic access to view certain data assets' metadata (name, properties, schema, lineage) within the Unified Catalog without having to register and scan the data source as either a data reader or owner. Limited to [select sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/live-view#what-resources-have-live-view-available). | Allow immediate access to end users to jump-start your organization's data discoverability and governance journey  | Requires Purview access (MSI recommended) to the resources. See [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/live-view#live-view-permissions) for details. |


# Business Value
Good data governance enables the entire organization to gain business value from your data in a secure manner. The Unified Catalog does so by enabling every persona of your organization to **maximize the value of their data by improving discoverability, collaboration, and compliance** while enabling **innovation and operational efficiency** in a highly regulated industry.

The Microsoft Purview Unified Catalog streamlines data governance, improving collaboration, and enabling better insights by:
1. **Acting as a Single Source of Truth for Data Assets** - consolidates metadata from diverse sources into a centralized platform, providing a consistent view of all enterprise data assets.
    - Value: Enables banking institutions to maintain a comprehensive inventory of data, **breaking down silos and ensuring consistency for decision-making and regulatory reporting.**
2. **Streamlining Regulatory Compliance** - classify, tag, and organize data assets in alignment with industry regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and BCBS 239.
    - Value: **Simplifies compliance processes**, **reduces the risk of non-compliance penalties**, and provides confidence during audits and regulatory reviews.
3. **Improving Discoverability and Usability** - leverage advanced search with AI, filter, and tagging capabilities make it easy for users to find and access relevant data assets quickly.
    - Value: **Enhances operational efficiency** by reducing time spent searching for data, enabling banking teams to focus on high-value activities like fraud detection and risk modeling.
4. **Fostering Collaboration and Innovation** - create curated, and well-documented data assets available to authorized users, promoting collaboration between departments (e.g., compliance, risk, and analytics teams).
    - Value: Facilitates the creation of new financial products, **improved customer personalization**, and cross-functional projects to enhance business outcomes.
5. **Supports Data Democratization with Built-in Governance** - ensures that data is accessible to the right people while protecting sensitive information with robust governance controls.
    - Value: Enables secure and governed access to data, **empowering teams with the information they need while minimizing risks** of data misuse or breaches.
