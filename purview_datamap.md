# Purpose
The Data Map is the technical arm of the governance side of Purview. Here you connect to and register data sources, manage your collection structure, monitor your data assets and define classification rules.
- Create an up-to-date map of your entire data estate that includes data classification and end-to-end lineage
- Identify where sensitive data is stored in your estate
- Create a secure environment for data consumers to find valuable data
- Generate insights about how your data is stored and used
- Manage access to the data in your estate securely and at scale

# Key Points
- Register your data source at the root if it must be shared across the first level of the collection hierarchy
- Most Policy Enforcment happens at the data product level
- Policies are created for governance domains and for data products
- Automatic policy enforcement is in preview for Azure SQL DBs, Blob Storage accounts and ADLS Gen2 accounts
- Governance domains tend to align to Fabric domains but its not necessarily a 1:1
